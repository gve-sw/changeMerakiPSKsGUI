# changeMerakiPSKsGUI
A GUI where network admins can select multiple SSIDs to change the PSKs. This saves time since on the Meraki Dashboard, you can only change one at a time. Can select the organization, the network(s), then multiple SSIDs to change. The user can optionally input their email address so that an email or message on Webex Teams will be sent to them notifying that the changes were made.
